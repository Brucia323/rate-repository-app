## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements

Tested with Node version 16, but later versions _might_ work as well) and npm. If you haven't installed Node or npm, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is an easy to use tool for installing both. Nvm is also handy if you want to quickly switch between different Node versions.

## üöÄ Getting started

1. run `npm install` in the `rate-repository-app` directory.

2. Create a file `.env` in the `rate-repository-app` directory and copy the contents of the `.env.template` file there. In the `.env` file, replace `SET_GRAPHQL_URI` variable values with your rate repository api's URI.

3. All done! Just run `npm start` to start the server. After the server has started you should be able to access the Developer tools at http://localhost:19002.
